# Task-02: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset



## Objective

The objective of this task is to clean and explore the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between variables that may help in understanding survival outcomes.

## Dataset

You can download the dataset from Kaggle: [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).



## Steps Taken

1. **Load the Dataset**:  
   Import the Titanic dataset and inspect its structure.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values (e.g., `Age`, `Cabin`).
   - Correct data types where necessary.
   - Remove duplicate entries.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summarize the dataset using descriptive statistics.
   - Analyze relationships between variables, such as survival rate by gender, class, and age.
   - Visualize data using charts (e.g., bar plots, histograms, heatmaps).

4. **Insights**:
   - Identify key features that influence survival outcomes.
   - Understand patterns such as class and gender disparities.
